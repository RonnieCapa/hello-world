# hello-world
Just another TEST repository
This Git Hub account is owned by Paolo Capanni. I'm an Italian Programmer developing in C, C++, C#, Rails, RoR and more and more ...
I wrote software especially in the field of timing live competions: - scoreboard firmware, displaying live data from timing equipment on screen or Video Grphics Generators, race sequences and so on.
I decided to use GitHub even if I'm usually a stand alone programmer to ahve a more structured and safe approach to the changes that I need to make on my softwares.
